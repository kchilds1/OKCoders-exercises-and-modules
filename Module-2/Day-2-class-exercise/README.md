bottles of beer on the wall

- prompt the user for a number to start with
- once you have the number from them, write in a <p> that many bottles of beer on the wall (e.g. 99 bottles of beer on the wall should be on the screen if they input 99)
- add a button that says "take one down"
- after clicking that button, the number of bottles should go down by one, and you should add that new sentence to the page
- the button should still be there, and clicking it should continue to decrement the number of bottles
