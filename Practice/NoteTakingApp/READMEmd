# Objective 
- Create a note taking app where you type in a note
- The note entered should dynamically come under a green Add Note button.
- The note added should have a button so that I can see the whole note in a popup overlay and I can x out of it.

## Challenges
- It was a challenge for me to find a way to find a way to have my input value display on the console.  I need to remember to assign the variable.value to a new variable within my function.
## Steps
- first created my index.html and linked my js and css file to it.
- simple html and css.  CSS in Flex box for phone usage. Not going into details about css and html because this is a JavaScript functionality project.
- Pulled all of my necessary elements into Javascript file.
- Added event listener to see when the Add Note button is clicked.
- created a function for click handling and tested inside the clickHandler function to make sure the event listener is working correctly
- Within my ClickHandler function I create a new variable noteContent to store the value of note.
